# React + Vite Setup

This project uses **React with Vite** to build a fast and modern
frontend application with hot module replacement (HMR).

Vite provides an optimized development experience with quick reloads
and efficient builds, making it suitable for UI-focused applications
such as dashboards and admin panels.

## ⚙️ React Integration

The project uses one of the official Vite plugins for React support:

- **@vitejs/plugin-react** – Uses Babel for React Fast Refresh
- **@vitejs/plugin-react-swc** – Uses SWC for faster compilation and refresh

Either plugin enables a smooth development workflow with instant updates.

## ⚡ Development Notes

- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is enabled for faster UI iteration
- ESLint is configured with basic rules for code consistency
- The setup is optimized for development and learning purposes

---

## 🔧 Linting & Future Enhancements

For larger or production-ready applications, TypeScript and
type-aware ESLint rules can be added.

The official Vite React TypeScript template can be used as a reference
to extend this setup when needed.
